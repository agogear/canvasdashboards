## Goals

Employability skills have become increasingly important in higher education. A recent report from the Australian Computer Society (ACS) 
states successful careers in ICT depends heavily on the skills of effective and compassionate communication, ethics, self-regulated learning,
collaborative teamwork, or impactful stakeholder engagement, among others. We identify two challenges in the current higher
education programs: (1) we do not sufficiently assess employability skills as learning outcomes; and (2) we do not provide a clear student
journey map of employability skill acquisition across courses.
The aim of this research is to better understand the nature of employability skills teaching and assessment that can take place in Canvas
through the lens of learning analytics and self-regulation.
