## Ethics Approval For Your Project
There is a new (in 2021) process for ethics approval for Masters projects, which you must follow if you are conducting research with people: 

* Discuss with your supervisor whether your project requires Ethics approval. If you plan to work with people at all, for example, by observing them, or by asking them to participate in a study, then you must have Ethics approval.
* All students who will be doing research with people must complete the university's [Research Integrity Online Training (RIOT)](https://catalog.lms.unimelb.edu.au/browse/communities/courses/research-integrity-online-training-riot). There are 8 modules, with a quiz at the end of each. You must achieve at least 80% in each module to successfully complete the program.
When you are done, download your completion certificate. You will need to send this to your supervisor, to show that you have successfully completed the training and you must submit it with your project proposal document.
* Your supervisor may already have Ethics approval for a project that includes your work. If they do, they should submit an amendment to their project to make sure that your name is included. They should share with you the Ethics approval letter that includes your name, so that you can include it as an appendix in your thesis.
* If your project is considered Low Risk, you may apply through the subject-level Ethics approval. Your supervisor will advise you on this process.
