# Preparing a Project Proposal

As part of the CIS Projects (INFO90008/COMP90055), you are required to submit a project proposal. The proposal sets out what you intend to do during the semester. Think of it as a way to play your work, discuss your progress, and ask your supervisor for feedback.

Your proposal should be 2-3 pages long (800-1000 words).

For a research project, this could include:

- A brief summary of the background literature:
  - What do you know about this topic (based on existing research)?
  - Why does this topic matter?
- Brief description of the research gap or problem statement: why is this research needed?
- Research question(s): what will your research investigate?
- Proposed methods: what will you do in order to answer the research questions? How will you conduct your research? For example:
  - If you are doing a systematic literature review:
    - databases you plan to search; search terms;
    - criteria for determining which papers you will include in your review (e.g., only papers published in the last xx years; only papers that report empirical findings; only papers focusing on a specific group of people);
    - and, if applicable, a theoretical framework for analysing/evaluating the literature.
  - If you are analysing existing data (e.g., information on the web):
    - explain how you will obtain the data and how you plan to analyse the information.
  - If you are conducting online interviews:
    - introduce the interview questions;
    - describe how you plan to recruit participants;
    - describe how you will conduct the interviews (voice chat? video chat? how will they be recorded?);
    - outline how you will analyse the interview data.
- Proposed timeline with key milestones and deadlines.

Your Project Proposal should also include an indication of what you have done so far. For example, if you have completed Ethics training (RIOT), include that in your timeline.

If your research will involve other people, your project proposal  *must* also demonstrate that you have considered appropriate ethical considerations and that you have completed the required Ethics training. You will need to complete a project report form. We will share more information about this as soon as it is finalised.
