# Introduction to CANVAS Dashboards

Dr Paula de Barba

Dr Eduardo Oliveira

## What is the focus of your project?

We aim to understand how students perceive their online learning experience on Canvas. What do they access in the LMS? How often they access the LMS and available resources?

Not so interested in the CANVAS system itself – more the way that we can customise information and include or exclude information for students to use.

## How can you do the project?

#### MIT students:

You could focus on the development of dashboards to particular subject or subjects.

You could focus on the development of dashboards to a particular section of CANVAS eg lecture content, discussions content, assignments, etc.

SRL focus/approach

#### HCI students:

You could focus on FIELDWORK where you ask students what they like or don&#39;t like about their current subjects/Canvas features and then synthesise that into a dashboard recommendation.

You could focus on EVALUATION where you look at a few subjects and get students (who aren&#39;t necessarily enrolled in that subject) to explore and give you feedback about the design. That evaluation could potentially inform the design of dashboards.

## What should I look at?

#### MIT:

Learning analytics, Canvas API and Canvas Subjects.

#### HCI:

From your evaluation/analysis, what recommendation/s can you provide in terms of how we structure customised dashboards in the LMS? Are there analytics/dashboards we could develop and integrate to the lms to help students in future?

## Recommended readings

This week, start with some background readings about the use of LMS by students. Here are some samples:

#### Everyone:

Think, also, about the methods that you will use in your study. How will you structure your semester&#39;s work?
